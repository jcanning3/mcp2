event has many instructions through event_instructions

  every event Type will have a list of Tasks

  every Event will be able to see the list of Tasks because of its event type

  every Event will use the lsit of Tasks as labels for Instructions and Assignemnts

  An instruction references a Task
  every Event will have a list of Instructions
    you can sort these instructions by Task.order
  every Event will have a list of Assigments

  every Event
    will use it's type to get a list of Task labels
    will have multiple Instructions - each related to a Task
    will have multiple Assignments - each related to a Task


        EVENT 1
	x		x		x	
	Tasks		Instructions	Assignments
	 T1		 I1		 A1
	 T2		 I2		 A2

        EVENT 2
	x		x		x	
	Tasks		Instructions	Assignments
	 T1		 I1		 A1
	 T3		 I3		 A3


  Type			Event
    id			  id
    name - rehearsal	  name

Thoughts about ticket tracking

    salesReport
	date
	vendor (flynn, square, lccmf)
	concert (date)
	category (pass, adult, student, comp)
	description
	count
	unit_price



rails generate scaffold ticketCategory name:text
rails generate scaffold vendor name:text
rails generate scaffold salesReport date:datetime vendor:references concert:datetime ticket_category:references description:text count:integer unit_price:integer

    ticket_category has many sales_reports
    vendor has many sales_reports

    sales_reports belongs to ticket_category
    sales_reports belongs to vendor
